Hello!

This is my assignment for Module 3 part two: UI Framework. I made a site using Tailwind CSS.

Tailwind is a middleman between Bootstrap and vanilla css. It has premade classes for anything that needs styling and you can style so much. 
Tailwind is very light and easy to learn, and free! It was nice using it but it crammed up my html as you can see. 
It can be a bit hard to navigate index.html. I tried my best to add comments where it was relevent. 
Tailwind also offers you to make a config file to group together classes you use often to referance once in the html.
I did not make a config, I wanted to try to make a site only writing two html files. It looks okay in the end but damn that was one tedious task. 
At times I stopped and asked myself "Why am I using this, I could just as well write css" but when I started memorizing the classes it went by faster. 

This is a site I made up that offers workshop classes that teach practical life skills such as repairing your clothes and woodworking. 
It is fully responsive. Tailwind has a neat simple system to add classes to breakpoints, they offer four breakpoints and it came in handy.

The only pages available are Index.html and About.html. Click on about to go to about. Click the logo in the left top corner to return home.


Thanks for reviewing!
